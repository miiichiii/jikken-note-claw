## 1. MAFB & MCTO Project
- **PMID: 41658793** - **Atypical Early Presentation of Multicentric Carpotarsal Osteolysis: Ankle Pain and Cavovarus Deformity Without Osteolysis.**
  - *Summary:* A crucial case study highlighting that MCTO (MAFB pathogenic variant confirmed) can present as ankle pain and cavovarus deformity *before* classic carpal/tarsal osteolysis appears. This expands the early diagnostic criteria for the MCTO project.
- **PMID: 41692233** - **Targeting MAFB potentiates immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages to an M1-like phenotype in colorectal cancer.**
  - *Summary:* Demonstrates that MAFB is a critical cell-intrinsic regulator of M2-like TAMs. Targeting MAFB shifts macrophages toward an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype, suggesting MAFB's role in controlling macrophage plasticity in disease contexts.

## 2. Macrophage-Neuro Project
- **PMID: 41703302** - **Autoimmune neuroinflammation leads to neuronal death via MIF nuclease-mediated parthanatos.**
  - *Summary:* Identifies macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) nuclease as a mediator of genomic fragmentation in parthanatos, leading to neuronal death. Blocking this pathway reduces disease severity in autoimmune models.
- **PMID: 41698047** - **Nanotherapeutic Macrophage-Neuro Reprogramming Through Immunometabolic Crosstalk Mitigates Sepsis-Induced Lung Injury and Neurologic Damage.**
  - *Summary:* Showcases a nanotherapeutic approach to reprogram macrophage-neuro crosstalk, mitigating systemic inflammation and secondary neurological damage.
- **PMID: 41660610** - **Mafb deficiency in myeloid cells increases susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice.**
  - *Summary:* Mafb is essential for myeloid cell defense; its deficiency leads to higher bacterial loads and systemic vulnerability.

## 3. Natto-Liver Project
- **PMID: 40515495** - **Effect of Bacillus Subtilis BN Strain on M1 Macrophage Antiviral Response.**
  - *Summary:* Research on *B. subtilis* (Natto-related strain) showing it enhances M1 macrophage antiviral responses, supporting the immune-modulatory benefits of Natto components in systemic health.
