# Email Preferences
- **No Self-Introduction**: Do NOT start emails with "I am Hamada" (濱田です) or similar self-introductions. The recipient knows who the sender is.
- **Signature**: Use "濱田 理人" (Michito Hamada) at the end.
- **Tone**: Polite, professional, but natural.
- **Model Usage**: Use GPT-OSS 120B (oss-120B) only for sub-agent tasks, not for real-time conversation, as it's too slow.
