- **Task/Schedule**:
  - 17:00 Tsukuba Univ. (Colony count / Fertilized egg storage check) reminder set.
  - User explicitly requested **active emoji reactions** in *all* group chats as a sign of "seen/understood". Added to `memory/preferences.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

- **Project: c-2925 Review**:
  - User lost track of "his results" (likely supervisor review or his comments).
  - Located `run_gemini/A_summary.md` and `run_gemini/BC_comments.md` inside `c-2925`.
  - Copied them to `c-2925/A_final_review.md` and `c-2925/User_comments.md` for easier access.

- **Student Support (Eugenia)**:
  - Abstract draft received: "Macrophage-Specific MAFB Deletion Does Not Disrupt Estrous Cyclicity..." (Negative data on steady state).
  - Target conference: **IFAA 2026** (August, Melbourne).
  - Advice given: Frame negative results positively as a "critical baseline" for stress/pathological models; ensure KO efficiency is mentioned to preempt reviewer doubts.
