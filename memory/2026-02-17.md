# 2026-02-17
- **Gmail Label Cleanup**: センセイ requested a cleanup of his "chaotic" label list.
  - Created a parent label `[Archive]` (ID: `Label_35`) to house old projects.
  - Identified 7 labels with zero messages: `医学群５クラス`, `Alumni`, `図書委員　レビュー調査`, `要返信`, `参照`, `処理済み`, `[Archive]`.
  - Confirmed that the `gog` CLI lacks label rename/delete capabilities. センセイ manually hid/deleted unused labels via the Web UI.
- **Calendar & Cron**:
  - Scheduled the "2月医科学センター会議" (Medical Science Center Meeting) for 2026-02-18 at 12:20 JST with Zoom details.
  - Fixed a syntax error in the `Daily gog calendar check` cron job (removed unnecessary `list` argument).
- **Reliability & Identity**:
  - **Telegram Reaction Rule**: Reinforced the safety valve to abort reactions if `messageId` is missing from metadata, preventing 400 Bad Request errors. This was discussed as a high-priority rule for `SOUL.md`.
  - **Assistant Name**: Formally updated the system configuration (`ui.assistant.name`) from the default `ibot` to `macstudio-bot` to align with `IDENTITY.md`.
  - Discussed the mechanics of memory: `MEMORY.md` is read once at session start, while `SOUL.md` is a foundational prompt read on every bootstrap.
