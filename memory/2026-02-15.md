- **Communication Issues**: Connectivity was unstable earlier today; WhatsApp gateway timed out (408). センセイ inquired about offline capabilities.
- **Offline Mode**: Confirmed that local models (LMStudio/Ollama) and file operations work offline, but messaging (Telegram/WhatsApp), cloud APIs, and web search require an internet connection.
- **Control Interface**: Pointed out that the OpenClaw Dashboard is accessible via browser at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` on the Mac Studio (loopback-only).
- **Preference Update**: センセイ explicitly requested *not* to change network/access settings (like Tailscale for the browser UI) due to past issues where such changes broke the system.
- **Calendar**: Added "コロニーの写真撮影" (Colony photography) to the Google Calendar for 2026-02-16 17:30-18:30 JST following other evening events.
- **Memory/Rule Update**: Formally updated `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` to specify using "local models" (LMStudio/Ollama) generally for email tasks, rather than naming specific models like DeepSeek, as they may change.
- **Technical Knowledge**: Discussed the creator of OpenClaw, Peter Steinberger.
- **Current Model Specs**: Verified that the active model `gpt-oss-120b` is running the `F16` (16-bit) version located on the external SSD (`/Volumes/SSD2TB`), while other models like `DeepSeek-R1-70B` are using `Q4` (4-bit) quantization.
